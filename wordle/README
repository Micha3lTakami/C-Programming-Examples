A simple string version of the popular New York Time's word game, Wordle. 
The client gets 5 guesses to figure out the word, with each guess giving them a 
result character by character in the form of a color - green meaning the character 
is in the word and the correct spot yellow meaning the character is in the word, 
but not the correct spot, and grey for the character not being in the word at all.
