Using a graph ADT(which is built on the previously made List ADT) performs a DFS 
on the graph given in the input file in order to determine the strongly connected 
components which are then output into a text file.

List.h - header file containing List declarations

List.c - List ADT implementation

Graph.c - Graph ADT implementation 

Graph.h - Graph ADT header file containing function declarations and structs

GraphTest.c - isolated tests utilizing graph ADT to test DFS
NOTE: time is treated as a local static variable and is thus passed by reference 
to visit()

FindComponents.c - finds the strongly connected components based on the graph in
the input file

Makefile - compiles and creates executable

README - this file!
